Open the telegram web on any browser and open a chat. Press `ctrl+shift+i` on Windows or `cmd+alt+i` on macOS to open developer tools. After opening the developer tools, go to the `Console` tab. Copy-paste the content of the `script.js` file in the console and hit enter. Wallah! You just got spammed!
