# Introspection

## Why must we choose you?

I LOVE CODING.  I am a half-introverted chill guy who spends most of his time sitting in front of the computer, either playing games or coding. I came into the world of programming at the age of 13. Solving problems is one of the most favorite parts of coding for me. Web development is my field of experience. I consider myself as a full-stack developer having a strong point in JavaScript, PHP (Laravel), etc. Runner-up in **World Skills India 2018** represented India in **World Skills Asia, Abu Dhabi 2018** in the trade Web technologies.

## What is your plan for the next 6 months?

Get better. There is always room for getting better, no matter how good you are. With a good team like amFOSS, I could achieve many things that I couldn't do before. Web technologies being my sole field of expertise, I would like to get out of my comfort zone and explore the various other things that the world has to offer me. Extremely interested in algorithms and data structures.

## How would you contribute back to the club?

Learn together. I would love to share everything that I know with others. 

## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

Nothing that I can think of at the moment.
